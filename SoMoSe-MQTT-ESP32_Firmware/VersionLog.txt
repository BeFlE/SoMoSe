ESP32- Firmware:

      Version 0.16: -Release

      Version 0.17: -Fixed error in diagram on "Home"-tab
                    -"Was ist neu?" - Button added

SoMoSe v3- Firmware:

      Version 1.3:  -Release

      Version 1.4:  -Current consumption in LowPower mode improved (800uA(v1.3) -> 16uA(v1.4) in standby)



Planned:  -Simple mechanism for direct watering via GPIO pins of the ESP
          -Sleep mode to save energy, measurement and visualization of the battery voltage and the solar panel voltage, if connected
          -Translation into different languages
